# Tinkerbird_SongGene

Abstract:
Bird song, whether learned or innate, mediates reproductive isolation but the genetic basis of song is poorly understood because of the confounding effect of vocal learning in model systems. Using admixture mapping of whole genomes across a hybrid zone of vocal
non-learning Pogoniulus tinkerbirds, we show that the speed of rhythmic song is associated with two genes that affect speech in humans, Neurexin-1 and Coenzyme Q8A. Leveraging ancestry to investigate how hybridization impacts song, we find that yellow-fronted tinkerbirds and individuals with mixed ancestry at candidate loci sing less stable rhythms than red-fronted tinkerbirds. Furthermore, we find evidence for character displacement in song stability and asymmetric assortative mating, suggesting that genes shaping vocal rhythm play a pivotal role in mediating pre-mating isolation and speciation.
