# Tinkerbirds_SongGenes

Abstract:
A diversity of sounds pervades the natural world, and differences in acoustic traits among species have long been thought to maintain reproductive isolation. However, the genetic underpinnings of the acoustic phenotype are poorly understood. In birds, song variation due to cultural learning is a common phenomenon in many species and may obscure its genetic underpinning. Here, we focus on two species of tinkerbird that hybridise extensively in a contact zone in Southern Africa, and whose simple songs are genetically determined and share rhythmic features with primates and songbirds. We performed genome-wide association and admixture mapping studies on resequenced genomes of individuals recorded across the contact zone to investigate the genomic foundation of the key difference in the two species song â€“ its pace. We uncovered for the first time the polygenic nature of song pace in wild birds by identifying at least four candidate genes on chromosome 25: NRXN1, COQ8A, MSH2 and ENAH associated with how fast a bird sings. Overall, our study identifies for the first time candidate genes underlying rhythmic song pace and sheds light on the genetic architecture of an important trait known to mediate species recognition in birds.
